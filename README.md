# Cobra

Cobra is a HITMAN: Absolution server replacement developed by The Peacock Project. It restores all online functionality to the game.

This project is currently **in-development**.

## Installation

As this is in-development, there are no exact final installation instructions. A basic plan for what we
want for this can be seen below:

### Public Instance

Due to the nature of Absolution's online implementation, there is no real reason to host this locally like
[Peacock](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock). So, The Peacock Project is planning to host a public
instance of the server for people to connect to. Currently, these instances will be disjoint from one another,
but there are plans (for very far into the future) to make an API for contracts and leaderboards.

### Self-hosting

Instructions for this are TBC, but see above for why this may not be an ideal option.

## License

Cobra is licensed under the AGPL-3.0 license, see the license file for more info.

## Credits

All the groundwork for Cobra is based off work done by [LennardF1989](https://github.com/LennardF1989) in his
[Hitman-5-Server](https://github.com/LennardF1989/Hitman-5-Server) repository. This prototype implementation
has been re-written into a fully working server replacement, but we are hugely grateful for all the work Lennard
has done.

The game is owned by [IO Interactive](https://ioi.dk/) who are in no way affiliated with this project.
